Use this text file to coordinate the spec for levels. That way the code.js and levelgenerator.js will be able to exchange level files.

This doesn't actually do anything in the code. It's just for organization.

SPEC:

Functions:

Code.js can call levelgenerator.js with the following function:

generateRandomLevel(parameters)

The parameters is an object with keys that we can decide on later to specialize the generated level e.g. create an enemy spawn only level or a maze without enemies, or just make a level really hard.

The levelgenerator.js will return an array. Each object in that will have "x" and "y" keys specifying its position on a grid. Then there will be a string "name" for the name of the object e.g. "Monster" or "Exit" or "Wall". Depending on the object, there might be extra parameters. The Monster could have an HP key.
So an object in the array would look like
{"x":0, "y":2, "name":"Monster", "HP":100}

LIST OF OBJECTS AND THEIR PARAMETERS:

(edit this list! add good objects and remove bad ones)

"Exit": Player gets to this to win the level.

"PlayerSpawn": Where a player starts.
Additional key "PlayerNumber": Which player starts there

"Monster": An enemy
Additional key "HP": The HP of the monster
(probably should add more keys later)

"Wall": Can't move through this

"MonsterSpawn": spawns monsters
AdditionalKey "Waves": array of waves (arrays of"Monsters" (with no "x" or "y" keys because they spawn at the monster spawn))
Sample MonsterSpawn: {"x":0, "y":0, "name":"MonsterSpawn", waves: [
[{"HP":10}, {"HP":25}"],
[{"HP":30}],
[{"HP":1}]
]}
The first wave has 2 monsters with 10 and 25 hp each. The second wave has 1 monster with 30 hp and the 3rd wave has 1 monster with 1 hp


LIST OF PARAMETERS TO PASS TO LEVELGENERATOR (optional):

"MonsterOnslaught":[num] creates a monster onslaught with [num] waves
Additional Keys: Add a key here if you want to custom control the monster onslaught more

"Difficulty":[num] increases the difficulty. Not sure how it should work: change monster HP or speed of number of monsters?
