# Spaceship Tanks: *Realtime*

This is not a turn based strategy game. It is an experimental realtime spaceship combat game based off of Spaceship Tanks.  
HAHAHAH
#TODOS:
~~Change the movement system so instead of moving up down left right you just move forward backward and rotate left/right.~~  
Add an attack system where you can ~~rotate the turret and~~ shoot bullets.  
Add animations for attack and movement.
