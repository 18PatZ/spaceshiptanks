# Spaceship Tanks: Reengineering  

Called spaceship tanks because apparently those are easier to sprite. What this really is is a turn based strategy game. The key draw is that your units have special abilities and can level. Whether units are trainable or not has yet to be determined.  

The Reengineering branch is meant to create a scalable turn based engine for the game. It will replace the master branch once it achieves feature parity with it.  

Our current goal is this:  
 * Grid with four units.
 * Two players and 'next turn' button which changes the current player.
 * Current player can move corresponding units around.
 * Units have different number of move squares per turn.
 * Units can attack each other (and have hitpoints).
 * Units have special powers which require a certain number of turns to cooldown before they can be used again.
