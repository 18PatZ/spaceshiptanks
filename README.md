# Spaceship Tanks: Reengineering  

Currently working towards checkpoint one.
 * Grid (Implemented!)
 * Four units (Two right now)
 * Two players and 'next turn' button which changes the current player. (NOT implemented)
 * Current player can move corresponding units around. (Movement implemented, but not with player system)
 * Units have different number of move squares per turn. (Implemented!)
 * Units can attack each other (and have hitpoints). (HP, but no attacks)
 * Units have special powers which require a certain number of turns to cooldown before they can be used again. (NOT implemented)
