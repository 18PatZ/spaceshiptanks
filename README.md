# Spaceship Tanks: Reengineering  

Checkpoint 1 features that still need to be implemented:  
 * Turn system with two players
 * Unit hitpoints and attack
 * Unit abilities with multiple turn cooldowns
 * CSS unit and tile highlighting to eliminate need for separate image files for selected units and highlighted tiles (new!)
